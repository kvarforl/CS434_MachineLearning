q1* files in this directoy demonstrate a **linear regression model** with the goal of predicting the median value of housing in an area based on 13 features. The fit of the model is judged using average squared error.

q2* files in this directory demonstrate a **logistic regression classifier with regularization**. The goal of the classifier is to classify a USPS handwritted digit dataset as either a 4 (class 0) or a 9 (class 1).

### [implementation2/](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS434_MachineLearning/tree/master/implementation2)

The project in this directory classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using the bag of words representation and a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier with **Laplace Smoothing**. The project explores the impact of parameters such as alpha (q4), count vecotrizer parameters (q5), and the use of a validation set in addition to the testing and training sets.
