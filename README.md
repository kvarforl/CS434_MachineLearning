### [implementation1/](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS434_MachineLearning/tree/master/implementation1)

q1* files in this directoy demonstrate a **linear regression model** with the goal of predicting the median value of housing in an area based on 13 features. The fit of the model is judged using average squared error.

q2* files in this directory demonstrate a **logistic regression classifier with regularization**. The goal of the classifier is to classify a USPS handwritted digit dataset as either a 4 (class 0) or a 9 (class 1).

### [implementation2/](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS434_MachineLearning/tree/master/implementation2)

The project in this directory classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using the bag of words representation and a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier with **Laplace Smoothing**. The project explores the impact of parameters such as alpha (q4), count vecotrizer parameters (q5), and the use of a validation set in addition to the testing and training sets.

### [implementation3/](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS434_MachineLearning/tree/master/implementation3)

This directory contains project code for a decision tree ensemble to predict election results from US county statistics. It contains code that generates a basic **Decision Tree Classifier**, in addition to a **Random Forest** generator, and an implementation **AdaBoost**. 

### [implementation4/](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS434_MachineLearning/tree/master/implementation4)

This project explores **k-means clustering** and **dimension reduciton (PCA)** algorithms for identifying what activity (standing, running, sitting, etc...) a Sumsung Galaxy S3 phone detects its user is participating in based off of its accelerometer and gyros data.
