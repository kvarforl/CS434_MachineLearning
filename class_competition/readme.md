This directory contains our scratch work for entering a Kaggle competition with the goal of extracting the text that causes each tweet to be a given sentiment.

The highest scoring and most complete files are cv_bayes.py and wordcount_best.py.

The rest of the files are less performant or incomplete, but kept for a record of brainstorming.
