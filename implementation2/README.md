A **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier** to distinguish negative movie reviews from positive ones.
______
q3.py trains a classifier with Laplace smoothing alpha = 1 and reports it's accuracy on the validation data set. It applies the same model to the testing set and reports it's predictions to test-prediction1.csv.

q4.py trains the classifier with a variety of alpha values between 0 and 2 and outputs the predictions using the best alpha value to test-prediction2.csv

q5.py trains the classifier with an altered vectorizor max_features parameter of 5500 and outputs its predictions to test-prediction3.csv
